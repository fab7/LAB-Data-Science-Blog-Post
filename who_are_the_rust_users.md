# BLOG - Who Are The Rust Users?

![Alt text](./images/Rust_Blog_Header_Image.png)<p align="center">

I was recently sharing my passion for building and programming systems with a colleague. During that exchange, he strongly recommended that I learn the **Rust** language in the near future  and get involved in its ecosystem.

Because I was under a heavy agenda, I did not have time to research the web and sort through the many videos, tutorials, articles and blogs such as: _[Rust in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C_HPTJg5ek)_, _[What's so good about Rust?](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/os-developers-know-rust/)_, _[What is it used fort?](https://yalantis.com/blog/rust-market-overview/)_, _[Why should I learn it in 2023?](https://www.i2tutorials.com/five-reasons-why-you-should-learn-rust-in-2023/)_.

At least, I wanted to understand who the Rust users were and what kind of development they were doing. The idea was to draw a parallel with my profile before delving deeper. 

With that goal in mind, I used the *2023 Stack Overflow Annual Survey* dataset to try to elicit this insight by asking the following four questions:
- *What are the job types of the Rust users?*
- *What are the best Rust paying jobs?*
- *What are the languages used in 2023 by the developers who plan to work with Rust in 2024?*
- *In what other languages do the Rust users plan to work in 2024?*

## The Dataset

[2023 Stack Overflow Annual Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/)

The Stack Overflow survey is conducted every year among tens of thousands of developers who share how they learn new and level up, 
which tools theyâ€™re using, how much they earn and how they are looking ahead to the future.

The last survey was conducted in May 2023 among 90,000 developers and the results can be downloaded from:
- https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey  

This kind of survey provides a wealth of information about the software developer community, the tools and the 
programming environments in use today.
With respect to the Rust language, you will find the following information:
- the number of users and its [popularity](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-popular-technologies-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages) compared to other technologies  
- the user satisfaction, apprehension and [desire to use](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-admired-and-desired-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages)
- the [pay rating](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-top-paying-technologies-top-paying-technologies) among other languages
- and a nice [mapping](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-worked-with-vs-want-to-work-with-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages) of the languages that users are interested in versus the ones they are already using. 






```
Therefore, this 5 minute blog might be for you as it attempts to provide insights about the users of Rust language in a visual way through charts and diagrams. 

If, like me, you want to learn more about Rust users, this 5 minute blog might be for you as it attempts to provide information about them visually through charts and diagrams.
